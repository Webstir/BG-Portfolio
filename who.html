			<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<!-- 			<hr class="ten-pad"> -->

			<img class="headshot" src="IMG/caitlin.png"><blockquote>"Ben does very good work creating clean-looking and aesthetic webpage design. He has an artistic eye, but also a talent for building sites that are meant to create sales and conversions. He also was very helpful at providing directions and guidance on specific tasks via printscreen images which helped tremendously. I would highly recommend Ben for your webpage projects!"</blockquote><cite><p>-<strong>Caitlin Thompson</strong>, Founder &amp; CEO at EntheoZen
			</p></cite>
			<br><hr class="ten-pad">

			<img class="headshot" src="IMG/thom.png"><blockquote>"Ben was hired on as our Electric Vehicle Technician, but as I got to work with him, his skills beyond the maintenance and management of this specialized subsection of our fleet became readily apparent. He is an incredibly creative guy, often coming up with solutions to problems we didn't even think of while the program developed.<br><br>
			His fingers were in many pies in the organization, though some of his best work that I saw came from his collaborations with our Marketing team. His eye for photography, design, and user experience were of great help to us as we developed our mobile app. His presence in the office was generally accompanied by an aura of enthusiasm, boisterous laughter, and a can-do attitude. Not to mention I have complete hair envy.<br><br>
			Working with Ben was a pleasure and any company looking for a creative thinker, problem solver, and cheerleader for finding newer and better ways to administer a product should be happy to have Ben on its team."</blockquote><cite><p>-<strong>Thom Matli</strong>, Data Analyst at City CarShare
			</p></cite>

			<br><hr class="ten-pad">

			<img class="headshot" src="IMG/marcus.png"><blockquote>"Ben is a standout talent who expertly filled a multiplicity of roles that in the context of our start up - or any start up for that matter - made him absolutely indispensable. Ben’s multitasking abilities made it possible to operate with fewer staff, minimizing the company’s burn-rate while simultaneously extending our operational capabilities.<br><br>
			Among key responsibilities, Ben designed, wrote copy, and provided photography for the company’s web site. He also managed inventory, assembled bikes and provided after-sales care. I wish Ben would let me hire him again!”</blockquote><cite><p>-<strong>Marcus Hays</strong>, CEO of PiMobility
