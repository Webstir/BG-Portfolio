			<p><strong>Frontend Design &amp; Development</strong>: <a href="http://thegoodcraft.com" target="_new">The Good Craft</a><span class="float-right">Jan 2017</span></p>

			<p>The Good Craft’s mission is twofold: to create an accessible space for new and talented artists to showcase their work, and to support our community by donating to a rotating local non-profit.</p>

			<p><strong>Frontend Design &amp; Development</strong>: <a href="http://entheozen.com" target="_new">EntheoZen</a><span class="float-right">2016</span></p>

			<p>I improved the logo resolution, usability, readability, consistency, aesthetics, font sizing, color scheme, &amp; understandability of the site, created a products overview page, and improved the information architecture, as well as arranging page elements in a more intuitive way.

		<h3 class="clear fade-in one">Experience</h3>

		<p><strong>UX, Web, &amp; Graphic Designer</strong>: Freelance Designer<span class="float-right">2016-current</span></p>

		<p>I&#39;m here to tell your story. I&#39;m here to work out usability bugs. I&#39;m here to rebrand your idea. I&#39;m here to find all the ways that your product can be better, improve the lives of your customers, and ultimately drive more business.</p>


		<p><strong>Designer &amp; EV Tech</strong>: City CarShare (non-profit)<span class="float-right">2014-2015</span></p>

		<p>Started in 2001, CityCarShare was the first carsharing company in the nation. We were building an All Electric and Plug-in Electric (PHEV) car share network to make it easily for people to get around- more affordable, more green, reducing congestion, and live without the hassle of car maintainence.  I also was building the first in the country electric bike share network. With a growing fleet of next-generation hybrids, electric cars, and electric bicycels, EVs coupled to outdoor solar charging stations, CityCarShare was pioneering a sustainable transportation network that I lead. I oversaw and maintained a fleet of 50 PHEVs, debugged our in-car technology, monitored car battery status remotely to ensure uptime, created maintenance logs, improved the mobile app UI, contributed on frontend web design, produced promotional videos, grant evaluation docs, rebuilt important accounting documents, and other marketing &amp; design material.</p>

		<p><strong>Founder &amp; Engineering</strong>: Onward Electric Cycles LLC<span class="float-right">2013-2014</span></p>

		<p>Started an electric bike company to develop a new hydraulic electric bike drive system. We were thinking completely outside the 'electrical box' and inventing a bicycle system built on the pumping of fluids and hydraulics instead. After 5 or 6 interations, I designed a hydraulic drive bike pump that achieved 10-15 PSI in pumping force by pedaling.</p>

		<p><strong>Operations, &amp; Web Design</strong>: PiMobility Inc.<span class="float-right">2011-2012</span></p>

		<p>PiCyle is a strikingly simple and beautiful electric bicycle, made of just a single arch. Electric Bicycles are the most efficient form of transportation achieving a stunning 2000MPGe in efficiency. This coupled with zero emissions, pennies to charge, the benefits of exercise, and the fastest way to get from point A to point B in an urban environment makes eBikes the best clean mode of transit. At PiMobility, I ran operations (inventory control), helped with sales, starred in promo videos, did photography, shot &amp; edited several promo videos, did web design layout and copy, managed the shop, assembled bikes, helped with concept ideation for product development and provided customer service.</p>

		<h3 class="clear fade-in one">Education</h3>
		<p><strong>General Assembly</strong>: UX Design Immersive <span class="float-right">2015-2016</span></p>

		<p>10 week full immersive (over 500 hours) for UX Design taught by UX practitioners. Course Work: User Research, Interface Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, Interaction Design, Mobile Design, Responsive Web Design, Usability Testing, Testing Methodologies, and Design Best Practices. Emphasis on Lean UX, rapid prototyping, and design studio. From research and ideation to prototyping and testing.</p>

		<p><strong>Online Courses</strong>: Frontend Web Development, Programming <span class="float-right">2013-2014</span></p>

		<p>Took courses online at iTunes U, MIT open courseware, Coursera, Code School, Code Academy, &amp; Thinkful. Learned Programming Fundamentals, iOS development, Java, Algorithms, Object-oriented Design, and Frontend Development.</p>

		<p><strong>Techshop</strong>: Metal &amp; Wood Fabrication, 3D Modeling, CNC, Lasercutting <span class="float-right">2013</span></p>

		<p>Took roughly 30 classes at TechShop related to 3D printing, finishing, aluminum and steel welding (MIG &amp; TIG), CNC mill and lathe, CAM/CADD software, injection molding, Arduino programming, circuit board soldering, wood fabrication, wood finishing, carbon fiber, sheet metal construction, powder-coating (painting), waterjet cutting, vinyl cutting, and more.</p>

		<p><strong>UC Davis</strong>: Landscape Architecture &amp; Electrical Engineering <span class="float-right">2007-2010</span></p>

		<p>At UC Davis I straddled the line between design and engineering. I pursued electrical engineering for one year, before switching into Landscape Architecture (LDA) for two years. LDA helped me hone my design, concept generation, &amp; presentation skills while electrical engineering helped me think logically through a problem and how to test &amp; debug. Ultimately, these two fields combined when I became obsessed with the electric bicycle as the future of transportation.</p>
